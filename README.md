# LEAF CLASSIFICATION
## 
The objective of this playground competition is to use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin & texture, to accurately identify 99 species of plants.
It follows a 2 stage pipeline, first using the images to learn representations via Deep Autoencoders, which are then concatenated to the   given featues and trained jointly on a DNN.
